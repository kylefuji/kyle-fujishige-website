# kyle-fujishige-website

This is my own personal portfolio website.

**The purposes for making this website are:**
- To learn React.js
- To learn Bulma css framework
- To have a Single Page Application
- To have an extendable website where every aspect is editable and extendable with no code (through the admin panel)
- To have a lightweight SPA which is very fast and doesn't do too many server calls
- To make the server extremely lightweight. This means we don't store any CDNs, including the babel CDN on the server, and thus we don't translate JSX to javascript. Instead, the client utilizes external CDNs, and thus the server doesn't have to serve a ton of information behind the scenes. Instead, we serve the javascript needed to create the html components directly with reacts very own React.createElement.
- To have a secure place to serve my information on the web.
- To have fun!
